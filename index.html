                    There are two competitions which members are welcome to enter each year, an individual competion and a team competition. Burnside has won both the team and individual competitions in the past.
                    <br><br>
                    Chess is a strategy game played by two players, "Black" and "White", based on the colour of the pieces they play with. Chess is played on an eight-by-eight grid of squares. In the game, both players try to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it in danger so it cannot escape. The king is the focal point of a game of chess as it is how the game is won, other pieces on the board including the rook and the queen are major threats which pose a risk to the king. The pawn is the piece which starts the game while guarding the major pieces including the king, queen, and rooks. It primarily supports and shelters major pieces and is often called the soul of chess.
