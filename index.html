                There are two competitions which members are welcome to enter each year, an individual competion and a team competition. Burnside has won both the team and individual competitions in the past.
                <br><br><br>
                Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. The game is typically won by checkmating the opponent's king by threatening it with inescapable capture or by a player resigning bceause they believe that they are going to lose. The game can also end in a draw when either player has no legal moves, when the pieces are in the same place for the 3rd time in a game, by the agreement of both players and many other reasons.
